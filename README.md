# GeoQuest

A fun geoguessing game for Microsoft Teams.

##  Project summary

### What is does
The only and essential goal of this app is to have fun in a group before the start of a joint meeting. Or even out of turn, if you like.
You can use it as an icebreaker, or to have a little competition about the order of speakers in a meeting. And in the end, it's just a lot of fun together.

### Inspiration
During the Covid-19 lockdown, we started as a team to begin our meetings with an icebreaker, or to play a little online game during virtual lunch breaks together. We always had a lot of fun playing a geo guessing game online live against each other. Unfortunately, something like that didn't exist as a teams app until that point.
When the LiveShare functions were made available to developers, the idea came up very quickly to implement such a game with the new technology in order to gain experience with it, to demonstrate the possibilities of the technology and to bring a little fun into the meetings.

## About the project

### What it is - _Type of the project_
This project is a Teams meeting app. The app can only be added to meetings. There it is available as an icon and the game leader can then open it, whereupon the control panel is then available in the sidebar. The game master then shares the app with all participants on the stage.
